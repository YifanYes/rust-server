# Multithreaded server in Rust

Multithreading is the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time. In the context of a server, this means that the server can handle multiple requests from clients simultaneously, without having to wait for each request to be processed before moving on to the next one.

When a server uses multithreading, it can handle more requests per unit of time, which can lead to better performance and faster response times. This is especially important in servers that receive a large number of requests, such as web servers, database servers, or game servers.

To run the server:

```
cargo run
```
